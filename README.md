This module is a cheat sheet for how to get `&T` or `&mut T` from various types of wrappers.
I started with the leaf nodes from <https://github.com/usagi/rust-memory-container-cs> and then
added a few traits.

Some of the examples have severe restrictions, and can be considered an example of why that
particular wrapper is a poor choice for some use cases.
